## Description
Maa means "mother". Its said that a women  that rocks a cradle rules the world. I got this idea from my mother who after losing her husband and having me and her 2 months daughter she struggled alone, walked alone, stood alone and became an inspiration and an example for every single women that yes life is possible alone. she never complained , she never cried , she only said that always smile because "yeh smle ek aisi chiz hoti hai jo sare gum chupa leti hai" which means that smile is the only thing which hides all pain of life. Today i am a qualified C.S student and its all because of my mother. A lady who sacrificed her whole life for her children . I still remember a day she faced when she was alone holding me in her right hand and my 2months sis on her left arm. she said that just walk along and let a day   come when u'l be at the top of the worldand today I salute the spirit of this lady and ready to dedicate my whole life to a women named " ratnanjali mishra". Thankyou maa
